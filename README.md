# 💸 Time Value of Money – Manim Animation

This animation visually explains a fundamental question in finance:  
**How much is £5 worth after one year at 25% interest?**  
**How much is £5 worth after fifty years at 5% interest?**

---

## 📘 Scenario Explained

> **Questions:**  
> If you invest **£5** today at an **annual interest rate of 25%**, how much will it be worth in **1 year**?
